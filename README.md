## Description

As a programmer, I want to spend more time on coding a program but do not want to ignore the importance of a good README
file. This application will dynamically generate a clean and professional README based on the input of the user,
prompted by a series of questions from the command-line executed by the "node index.js" command.

Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uRDHmz4OBj7ja9dvcLL4FXE7QSQOKxrG/view?usp=sharing) description.

## Installation:

    Via command-line, execute "npm i inquirer".

## Usage:

    This application will be used to quickly generate professional README files.

## Contributing:

    Demetri Dillard

## Test:

    Copy and Paste code from GitHub Repository. Replace my name with your name on line 5 of the generateMarkdown.js file using "%20" to add spaces. Via command-line, execute "node index.js" command.
