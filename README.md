  ## Description
    As a programmer, I want to spend more time on coding a program but do not want to ignore the importance of a good README file. This application will dynamically generate a clean and professional README based on the input of the user prompted by a series of questions from the command-line executed by the "node index.js" command. 

  ## Installation:
    Via command-line, execute "npm i inquirer".

  ## Usage:
    This application will be used to quickly generate professional README files.

  ## Contributing:

  ## Test:
    Copy and Paste code from GitHub Repo. Replace my name with your name on line 5 of the generateMarkdown.js file using "%20" to add spaces. Via command-line, execute "node index.js" command.
