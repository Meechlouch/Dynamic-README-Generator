  ## Description
    As a programmer, I would like to spend more time on coding an application but do not want to ignore the importance of a README.md file. This application will dynamically generate a clean and professional README.md file based on the input that the user provides through a series of questions asked from the command line triggered by the node index.js command

  ## Installation:
    This project required install of inquirer npm executed with the 'npm i inquirer'.

  ## Usage:
    This application will be to quickly generate professional README.md files.

  ## Contributing:

  ## Test:
    Copy and Paste code from Repository, replace my name with your name using '%20' instead of spaces to generateMarkdown.js on line 5. Via command-line, navigate to the folder of copied source code and execute the 'node index.js' command.
